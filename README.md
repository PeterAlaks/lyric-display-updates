## Verify your download (optional)

```

## Troubleshooting

* **Output windows not showing in OBS/VMIX:** Refresh/reload the Browser Source; ensure the app is running on the same machine or reachable host.
* **No updates found:** Check your internet connection; confirm you’re running a release build (not a local dev build).
* **Styling not applying:** Use the in‑app "Sync Outputs" control; then refresh your Browser Source in your live software.

See the **main app repo** for deeper troubleshooting guides and FAQs.
