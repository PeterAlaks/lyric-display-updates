## OBS Studio Integration

### Single Computer Setup (Recommended for Beginners)

This setup runs LyricDisplay and OBS on the same computer.

#### Step 1: Add Browser Source

1. In OBS, go to your scene
2. Click the **+** button in Sources panel
3. Select **Browser**
4. Name it "Lyrics - Output 1"
5. Click **OK**

#### Step 2: Configure Browser Source

Enter these settings in the Browser Source properties:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **URL** | `http://localhost:4000/#/output1` |
| **Width** | `1920` (match your canvas width) |
| **Height** | `1080` (match your canvas height) |
| **FPS** | `30` |
| **Shutdown source when not visible** | ✅ Checked (improves performance) |
| **Refresh browser when scene becomes active** | ✅ Checked (ensures reliability) |

Click **OK** to save.

#### Step 3: Test the Connection

1. In LyricDisplay, load a test lyric file
2. Click any lyric line
3. Switch to OBS - you should see the lyrics appear
4. Toggle the **Display Output** switch in LyricDisplay to hide/show lyrics

#### Adding Output 2 (Optional)

Repeat Steps 1-3, but use:
- Source name: "Lyrics - Output 2"
- URL: `http://localhost:4000/#/output2`

### Advanced: Positioning and Styling in OBS

1. **Right-click** the browser source in your scene
2. Select **Transform** → **Edit Transform**
3. Adjust position if needed (though LyricDisplay handles positioning internally)
4. Use **Filters** to add:
   - **Color Correction** for fine-tuning
   - **Sharpen** for crisp text on scaled outputs

## VMix Integration

### Adding LyricDisplay as Web Browser Input

#### Step 1: Add Input

1. Click **Add Input** in VMix
2. Select **Web Browser**
3. Enter these settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **URL** | `http://localhost:4000/#/output1` |
| **Width** | `1920` |
| **Height** | `1080` |
| **Frame Rate** | `30` |

4. Click **OK**

#### Step 2: Position as Overlay

1. Drag the Web Browser input to an **Overlay** channel (1-4)
2. This makes the transparent background work correctly
3. Lyrics will appear over your main video

#### Step 3: Test and Adjust

1. Load lyrics in LyricDisplay
2. Select a line to display
3. Check VMix preview - lyrics should overlay cleanly

## Network Setup (Multi-PC)

Use this setup when running LyricDisplay on one computer and OBS/VMix on another.

### Prerequisites

- Both computers on the **same network** (LAN or Wi-Fi)
- Ethernet cable connection recommended for stability
- Administrator access to configure IP settings

### Step 1: Assign Static IP to LyricDisplay Computer

#### On Windows:

1. Press **Win + R**, type `ncpa.cpl`, press **Enter**
2. **Right-click** your active network adapter → **Properties**
3. Double-click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**
4. Select **Use the following IP address**
5. Enter these values (adjust to your network):

   ```
   IP address: 192.168.1.100
   Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
   Default gateway: 192.168.1.1
   Preferred DNS: 8.8.8.8
   ```

6. Click **OK** → **OK** → **Close**

> **Important:** Choose an IP address that's not used by other devices. Check your router's DHCP range to avoid conflicts (typically 192.168.1.100-200 is safe).

### Step 2: Verify Connection

On the **LyricDisplay computer**, press **Win + R**, type `cmd`, press **Enter**, then run:

```cmd
ipconfig
```

Confirm your static IP appears under your network adapter.

### Step 3: Configure OBS/VMix on Second Computer

#### For OBS:

In Browser Source properties, change the URL:

```
http://192.168.1.100:4000/#/output1
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with your LyricDisplay computer's static IP.

#### For VMix:

In Web Browser input, use the same URL format:

```
http://192.168.1.100:4000/#/output2
```

### Step 4: Test Network Connection

1. On the OBS/VMix computer, open a web browser
2. Navigate to `http://192.168.1.100:4000`
3. You should see a connection or the LyricDisplay interface
4. If you get an error, check:
   - Both computers are on the same network
   - Windows Firewall isn't blocking port 4000
   - LyricDisplay is running on the first computer

### Firewall Configuration (If Needed)

If the connection fails, allow LyricDisplay through Windows Firewall:

1. On the **LyricDisplay computer**:
2. Search for **Windows Defender Firewall**
3. Click **Allow an app through firewall**
4. Click **Change settings** → **Allow another app**
5. Browse to `C:\Program Files\LyricDisplay\LyricDisplay.exe`
6. Ensure both **Private** and **Public** are checked
7. Click **OK**

## Secondary Controllers

Secondary controllers allow mobile or web devices to follow along without granting full desktop access.

1. In LyricDisplay choose **File > Connect Mobile Controller** (or click the shield icon) to display the QR code and current 6-digit join code. The code refreshes whenever the desktop app restarts.
2. On the secondary device, make sure it is on the same network, then scan the QR code or visit `http://<control-pc-ip>:4000/?client=mobile` and enter the join code.
3. After pairing, the mobile layout can trigger lyric lines, toggle the display, run manual sync, and submit lyric drafts that the desktop operator approves before they go live.
